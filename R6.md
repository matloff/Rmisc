# R6 classes

## Overview

The R language subscribes to both the object-oriented programming (OOP) and 
unctional programming (FP) philosophies.  Prudently, it does not go to
extremes with either of these philosophies, leaving it up to the user as
to how to what degree, if any, she wishes to use them.  Indeed, in the
case of OOP, the user has a choice of several OOP frameworks, including,
as noted, using none at all.

Here we discuss OOP, and in particular, a recent OOP paradigm in R,
called **R6**.  (Note:  **R6**

## S3 classes

R was developed largely as an open-source alternative to the S language
from Bell Labs.  The first -- and to this day most popular -- type of
OOP in R is known as **S3**, alluding to the structure in the S
language, version 3.

**S3** couldn't be simpler.  It's just an R list, with a class-name
attribute added.  Say I'like to have a class named **'xyPairs'** (class
names in R are always quoted).  I can create an object of that class
this way:

``` r
l <- list(x=c(5,12,13), y=c(8,88,0))
class(l) <- 'xyPairs'
```

We can then apply any R list operation to **'xyPairs'** objects, e.g.

``` r
> l$x
[1]  5 12 13
> length(l$x)
[1] 3
```

Two of the key tenets in the OOP philosophy are *encapsulation* and
*polymorphism*.  **S3** achieves of both these.  The first simply means
packaging several related objects into to bigger object, which happens
with **x** and **y** above.

The second means that we can tailor common R operations to specific
classes.  For instance:

``` r
> summary.xyPairs
function(xypObject) {
   print('x')
   print(head(xypObject$x))
   print('y')
   print(head(xypObject$y))
}
> summary(l)
[1] "x"
[1]  5 12 13
[1] "y"
[1]  8 88  0
```

In R, **summary()** is known as a *generic* function, just a
placeholder.  When evaluating **summary(l)**, the R interpreter will
ask, "What class is **l**?" The answer is **'xyPairs'**, so the
interpreter will *dispatch* the call to **summary.xyPairs()**.
